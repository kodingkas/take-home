## What I chose to do.

I put focus on the more visual things of this project. I really believe that how something looks can make or break your success with a consumer. I spent a good hour or so getting everything installed properly on my computer first running into errors. After digging around it seemed the version of node I had installed was clashing with the version of node-sass. After I got it working, I started messing around and figuring out how things connected to eachother. I have no prior experience with React, having only worked with Django framework, and the small exposure I did have was simply plugging in a Google Map module from google-map-react with the help of my mentor. I did not know what sass was before diving into the project as well.

After spending time and getting a basic understanding of how things were connected. I set about getting information to show up on the site. I think it is easier to develop by first getting the information you want to use showing up properly, then adding styling. Once that was done, I worked on the main task given to display information after a launch is clicked. I started looking into React Router and Link, but found myself getting lost in getting new linked pages. For the sake of not losing anymore time I decided to stay on the same link and have it so when a launch name is cliecked, it reveals more of the information. I just wanted to minimize the endless vertical scrolling like feeling a user might get with a list of launch names.


## What I would do with more time.

This was also my first time really working with an API, and I feel like I could have done a lot more better with how I was accessing information (I have a bug where it isn't pulling the right information on same). With more time I would have spent it making a more fleshed out summary of each launch. I did not really touch the navigation bar, and would have styled it to be responsive so that when I'm not using it, I get the whole screen for the main content. I really wanted a cool Carousel like affect everything. I tried to use a react carousel library and a parallax library but could not configure them to work properly. I felt like big visualizations was a way to go because rockets and space itself is big. More time would have allowed me to make more custom urls like having ".../launch/{launch_id} ." I feel like the structure of everything could have been changed to be a lot more organized. The break up of sass files for didn't seem great to me (but I may just not know sass development practices) as well as the React views and components folders. Writing tests would have also been more a priority.
